# 🚦 Traffic Accident Hotspot Analysis  
Analyze Accident Trends Across U.S. Cities (Synthetic Dataset) – Data Analysis & Visualization

This project investigates patterns in traffic accident data using a synthesized dataset that mimics real-world U.S. records. It aims to uncover accident hotspots across time (month, day of week) and severity levels through exploratory analysis and engaging visualizations.

---

## 📌 Features of the Project:

### ✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Uploading dataset interactively in Google Colab  
- Parsing timestamps and extracting useful features (Month, Day of Week, etc.)  
- Removing null or irrelevant records (if any)

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Accident frequency by month and day of the week  
- Severity distribution across locations  
- City and weather-wise accident trends  

### 📊 Visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Bar plots to compare accident counts by month and weekday  
- Count plots for severity and weather condition  
- Location-wise trends and summary charts  

---

## 📂 Dataset:
The dataset contains 1000+ synthetic traffic accident records across major U.S. cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York. It simulates realistic distributions of time, severity, and weather conditions across all 12 months.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used:
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy (for data handling)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)  
- Google Colab (for notebook execution)

## 📝 How to Use:
1. Open the `Traffic_Accident_Hotspot_Analysis_Final.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab  
2. Upload the file `US_Accidents_synthetic.csv` when prompted  
3. Run all cells to perform the analysis and view the visual insights  
4. Modify any section to explore different features or patterns  

---

## 📈 Key Insights:
- Highest number of accidents occur on Mondays and Fridays  
- Weekends generally report fewer incidents  
- Cities like New York and Los Angeles have higher simulated severity rates  
- Data patterns support the importance of weekday and location-based traffic planning
